Commands releated to a remote repository:

  - git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
  - git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

Commands releated to the workflow:

  - git add .
  - git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Commands releated to checking status or log history

  - git status
  - git log

The basic Git Syntax is program | action | destination.

for exmaple,

  - git add . is read as git | add |. , where the period represents everything in the current directory;
  - git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and 
  - git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
